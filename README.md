### Summary of the Libft Project in 42 Cursus

The **Libft project** is one of the foundational tasks in the 42 *Cursus*. It requires creating a custom C library that includes re-implemented standard C functions and additional utility functions. The project’s main goal is to strengthen your understanding of C programming fundamentals while preparing you for more complex projects later in the program.

### Objectives:
1. **Reimplement Standard Library Functions**:  
   - Write your versions of commonly used functions like `memset`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, `atoi`, and more from `string.h`, `stdlib.h`, etc.  
   - Understand their internal workings and edge cases.

2. **Add Utility Functions**:  
   - Implement useful additional functions like `ft_split` (splitting strings), `ft_itoa` (integer to string conversion), and linked list management (`ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_back`).

3. **Learn Modular Code Design**:  
   - Develop reusable, clean, and organized code for a modular library.  

4. **Prepare for Advanced Projects**:  
   - Use the `Libft` library as a foundation for future projects such as `get_next_line`, `ft_printf`, and others.

### Project Structure:
1. **Mandatory Part**:  
   - Reimplement basic standard C library functions.  
   - Handle string manipulation, memory management, and number conversion.

2. **Bonus Part**:  
   - Extend the library by adding advanced utilities like linked list handling functions.  
   - Focus on making the library more comprehensive and versatile.

3. **Submission**:  
   - Compile all functions into a static library (`libft.a`).  
   - Pass evaluations through peer review or automated testing (`Moulinette`).

### Skills Gained:
- **Low-Level Programming**:  
  - Mastery of pointers, memory allocation, and error handling in C.  
- **Debugging**:  
  - Learn to troubleshoot and debug low-level C programs.  
- **Foundational Knowledge**:  
  - Build a library that you’ll reuse in future 42 projects.  
- **Attention to Detail**:  
  - Precision and thorough understanding are crucial to completing this project.

### Importance:
The **Libft** project serves as the first major stepping stone in the 42 *Cursus*. It develops problem-solving skills, teaches core programming principles, and lays the groundwork for future projects. Success in this project reflects a solid grasp of C programming essentials.
